       <ul class="test">
         <li>Born in Mexico on January 10th 1975</li>
         <li>Soken and his family moved back to Tokyo where he would attend Tokyo University of Science, majoring in Chemistry. </li>
         <li>With musical roots in his family; his father a professional trumpet player and his mother a piano teacher, rather than pursue a career in science, Soken instead took an opportunity as a Sound Editor for an arcade game company. </li>
         <li>Joining Square in 1998, Soken assisted Kenji Ito working on various sports games.</li>
         <li>The first game where Soken was responsible for the soundtrack is "Nichibeikan Pro Baseball: Final League", a Japanese exclusive Baseball game in 2002 on the Sony Playstation 2.</li>
         <li>Throughout Soken's Musical career, he has been known under the following alias's; Masayoshi Kikuchi, Sorbonne Soken, and Luis Noma.</li>
         <li>Soken began working for Square Enix in 2001 as the roles of Composer and Sound Editor. Today, he is best known for his work on the Final Fantasy XIV series and its numerous expansions. </li>
         <li>In 2019, perhaps the most notable piece from Soken would have to be the now infamous "Civilizations" first unveiled at Fanfest Paris in February 2019. The track had been finished mere days before the event and was one of the last things Soken did before departing for the event where Director and Producer Noaki Yoshida approved it on-stage in front their European fans.</li>
         <li> In May 2021, it was unveiled at the digital Fan Festival livestream that Soken had been diagnosed with cancer in March 2020. Through chemotherapy for most of 2020, Soken's cancer is now in remission and now back on his feet. Throughout that time however, he continued to work regardless of his condition and kept it secret to not only the fans but almost the entire dev team who found out alongside everyone else during the announcement.</li>
